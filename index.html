      Coffee are small beans but it's one of the most important mood maker.
      for Us Coffee is not just for drink, it's for making up moods,thoughts and life so <strong>making up moods is our aim</strong>.
In a small village in about 50 years ago  my grandfather aws a huge fan of Coffee so he made his own style of drink and fell in deep love with the small coffee beans, he had an intresteing long story with coffee and he used to pick the beans from the farms, dry them, peel them, roast  the beans, crush them and <strong>make a fresh coffee everyday </strong>
     so it becoms our style and special way to make our product specail and fresh,
      we're known as a coffee family becuse we do things by ourselves,
     <strong> We provide you with a fresh Coffee wether you want it roast or raw, peeled or not, powder or beans</strong>.
      <strong>Please feel free to try our product once you enjoy it leave your opinion or suggestion here to serve you better next time</strong>
